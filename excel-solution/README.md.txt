# Excel-Based Forecasting Solution

This folder contains an Excel implementation of the customer support analytics and forecasting case study.

## What this workbook shows

- 2024 call volume, miss rate, and vendor performance summarised using Excel formulas and pivot tables.
- Q1–Q2 2025 call volume forecast built with spreadsheet logic instead of Python.
- Staffing calculations (agents per shift and total 24/7 headcount) performed using Excel formulas.

## Why include an Excel version?

Many teams rely heavily on Excel for operational planning.  
This workbook demonstrates that the same forecasting and staffing logic implemented in Python can also be built in Excel, making the solution easier to adopt for non-technical stakeholders.

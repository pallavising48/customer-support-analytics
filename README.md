# customer-support-analytics

Customer support call analytics, forecasting, and vendor optimization case study

## Executive Summary

- Analyzed **4.8M+ customer support calls** across shared and dedicated queues to understand 2024 volume patterns, vendor performance, and service quality.
- Found that **Vendor A handled ~59% of volume with 90.5% SLA** at a lower cost per call, while **Vendor B achieved higher satisfaction (~39.5%)** despite weaker SLA.
- Quantified that outages occurred on **~29% of days** but reduced SLA by **<1 percentage point**, showing strong operational resilience in the support model.
- Built a **Q1–Q2 2025 forecast (~2.5M calls)** with event-based adjustments (e.g., Easter, Mother’s Day) and translated it into **staffing plans of ~1,200 agents in Q1 and ~800 in Q2**.
- Recommended a **phased shift in vendor allocation toward Vendor A** to capture cost savings while maintaining an overall **SLA target of 88%+** and tracking satisfaction closely.
